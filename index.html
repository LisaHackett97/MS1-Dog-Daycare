                    </h2>
                    <p>Are you worried about your dog being alone while you work? Are you looking for more opportunities
                        for your small dog to socialise, but find that your dog gets nervous around bigger dogs at the
                        dog park? <br> If so, our doggy day care may be the right
                        place for your dog.
                        Dogs that are highly socialised and exercised are happier, healthier and less aggressive, and
                        are less likely to display destructive behaviours.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our day care specializes in the care of small sized dogs and puppies, so that we can focus on
                        building up their confidence.
                        Day care is a great way to keep your dog mentally and physically active. We provide a safe,
                        clean and supervised environment, with a consistent routine
                        to meet your dogs needs.
                        Your dogs are like family to us and will be treated with love, respect and kindness throughout
                        their time with us.

                    <p>We specialise in the care and socialisation of small dogs.
                        Dogs like people are social animals and need to be around others, to become well behaved,
                        balanced and confident. Physical and mental coordination, agility, prob solving, exploration and
                        understanding
                        of their environment are all important social skills for dogs to develop.
                    </p>
                    <p> Our trained staff have a daily consistent routine which helps build confidence and good manners.
                        We are all trained in dog behaviour and will spend time with all our canine guests to get to
                        know each of their
                        individual personalities, which will help us respond to them and ensure they are feeling safe
                        and secure.

                    <p>Freya founded her day care two years ago, as her schnauzer loved other dogs but was extremely
                        nervous of bigger dogs. She wanted to give Minnie the opportunity to be the best dog she could
                        be.
                        From the time she was a little girl, Freya has been surrounded by her canine companions, and has
                        volunteered at the WSPCA for the last 15 years, working with all different kinds of dogs.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are all a team of Dog People. Dogs are our family. Our team consists of a behavioural and
                        animal body language specialist, a trained veterinary assistant
                        and a qualified dog trainer.
                        We all volunteer at various dog charities and are required to complete all our certified
                        continuous training courses, including canine CPR and first aid.
