## Strategy and scope.
Looking at both strategy and scope of the project, I referred back to the user stories, which helped in planning out the project. 
On the strategy plane, I did some research looking at similar business types, and identified what worked well and not so well on the sites from a UX perspective. 
One main difference between sites was how easy it was to find relevant information. For my site, I listed out the opportunities/problems and how each of these might be addressed. 
And for the scope plane, I planned out the content and functional requirements.

## Structure of the website
The structure of the site is designed to be easy to navigate, on all device sizes. The nav bar includes an icon identifying the business, which will bring user back to home page, and a menu to link to all pages.
As one of the main of the site owner is to encourage contact to increase business, an easy to use contact form is included. each page will include a CTA button, which will bring user to the contact form.
Address of the business to be included in the header/nav bar to highlight location and contact phone number
Some information, wuch as maps to be hidden on smaller screen sizes so as not to present user with overload of info on the small screen.

## Wireframes
These were built using balsamiq.

I had planned to use Open Sans as a header and Lora for main text. I made a design decision during implementation and have decided to use the following fonts:
* Roboto Slab for main content.
* Lora for headers and nav bar text content.
* The font serif was used as a backup.

### Images

I used images from unsplash.com and pexels.com. Credited in the credits section.
One image was my own. 
The number of images and wheather or not to hide on smaller screens changed during the development of the site. All images are visible on all screens.
