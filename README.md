## Strategy and scope.
Looking at both strategy and scope of the project, I referred back to the user stories, which helped in planning out the project. 
On the strategy plane, I did some research looking at similar business types, and identified what worked well and not so well on the sites from a UX perspective. 
One main difference between sites was how easy it was to find relevant information. For my site, I listed out the opportunities/problems and how each of these might be addressed. 
And for the scope plane, I planned out the content and functional requirements.

The structure of the site is designed to be easy to navigate, on all device sizes. The nav bar includes an icon identifying the business, which will bring user back to home page, and a menu to link to all pages.
As one of the main of the site owner is to encourage contact to increase business, an easy to use contact form is included. each page will include a CTA button, which will bring user to the contact form.
