            <h3>Is daycare right for your dog?</h3>
            <p>Day care is not for every dog, and we want to ensure your dogs enjoy their time with us
                and s/he goes home to you happy.
                We provide a free meet and greet assessment: Not every dog is suited to day care and this time will
                allow us and your dog to see if we are a good fit.
                A time will be arranged with you to assess your dogs temperment and suitability to attend day care
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>
                Once accepted, what happens next?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Please book your dog in with us, if possible start with a half day.
                New dogs are introduced carefully and patiently, ensuring they do not get overwhelmed or stressed.
                At the assessment and again on their first few days, dogs are given an opportunity to sniff and explore
                for a few minutes.
                If your dog is feeling comfotable and tails are wagging, positive introductions are made.
                We want them to feel our day care is another home, and we are their 2nd family.
                We will work with you to continually assess that day care is the best place for your dog, but it is very
                important that you share any concerns with us.
                Please let staff know how your dog is reacting after they go home from day care.
            </p>
            <br>
